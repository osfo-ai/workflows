# osfo Workflows

Principles belong here: contracts that should remain true while implementations
change. Current setup, commands, and the repository map live in `README.md`.
Product truth lives in `CONTEXT.md`, durable decisions in `docs/adr/`, and active
work in GitHub Issues.

## Collaboration Notes

- The user uses speech-to-text; infer likely intent from odd wording, ask only when needed.
- Code is cheap to write: no time estimates, implementation time is not a blocker.
- Never use em dashes anywhere. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or separate sentences.

## Reference Repositories

Repositories in `.reference/` are available for patterns and comparison, not as
source code to copy blindly. Clone a given Git URL into `.reference/` and pull
the latest revision before using it.

## Engineering Priorities

- Prefer correctness and predictable behavior over short-term convenience.
- Preserve observable runtime behavior when changing lint, typing, tests, or internal structure.
- Keep crate boundaries clear; use public crate APIs rather than reaching into another crate's internals.
- Extract shared logic only when the shared behavior is real; avoid broad generic abstractions for one-off duplication.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live in GitHub Issues for `osfo-ai/Workflows`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the five canonical labels unchanged. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

This is a single-context repo: root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Other

Note mistakes in `MISTAKES.md`, missing context or tools in `DESIRES.md`, and
environment learnings in `LEARNINGS.md`.
