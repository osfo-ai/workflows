# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repository live in GitHub Issues at
`osfo-ai/Workflows`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments with `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "..."`.
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`. The `gh` CLI does this automatically
when run inside this clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** Set this to `yes` if the repository later
treats external PRs as feature requests. The `triage` skill reads this flag.

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using
the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`, then keep only `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` author associations.
- **Comment, label, or close**: use `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label` or `--remove-label`, and `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs. Resolve an ambiguous
number with `gh pr view <number>` and fall back to `gh issue view <number>`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

The `wayfinder` skill represents its map as one issue and its tickets as child
issues.

- **Map**: create one issue labelled `wayfinder:map` containing Destination, Notes, Decisions so far, Not yet specified, and Out of scope.
- **Child ticket**: link an issue to the map as a GitHub sub-issue through the sub-issues API. If sub-issues are unavailable, add the child to a task list in the map and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Apply one of `wayfinder:research`, `wayfinder:prototype`, `wayfinder:grilling`, or `wayfinder:task`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub's native issue dependencies. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`. The database ID comes from `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number> --jq .id`.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, then drop tickets with open blockers or an assignee. The first remaining child in map order is the next frontier ticket.
- **Claim**: run `gh issue edit <number> --add-assignee @me` before beginning work.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the ticket, and append a short linked context pointer to the map's Decisions so far section.
