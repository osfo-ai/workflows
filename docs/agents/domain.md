# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills consume this repository's domain documentation when
exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repository root.
- `docs/adr/` for decisions that affect the area being explored.

If either location does not exist, proceed silently. Do not suggest creating it
preemptively. The `domain-modeling` skill creates these files lazily when
terminology or a durable architectural decision is actually resolved.

## File structure

osfo Workflows uses a single-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
└── src/
```

`CONTEXT.md` is a domain glossary, not a technical specification. It defines
canonical business concepts and explicitly distinguishes terms that are easy to
conflate.

`docs/adr/` contains architectural decisions that are hard to reverse,
surprising without context, or the result of a real tradeoff.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When an issue title, implementation plan, hypothesis, or test names a domain
concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the
glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept is absent, reconsider whether the term belongs to this
domain. If it does, note the gap for `domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If proposed work contradicts an existing ADR, surface the conflict explicitly
instead of silently overriding it:

> Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but it may be worth reopening because...
